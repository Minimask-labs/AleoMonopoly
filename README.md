# AleoMonopoly
The Aleo Monopoly Game is a blockchain-based game where players can buy buildings, roll dice, compete against opponents, and earn rewards. The game is designed to be fun, competitive, and rewarding, with a focus on privacy and decentralization

# Getting Started
### Step 1: Connect Wallet

- Players must connect their Aleo wallet to the game interface.

- They need to sign a transaction to authenticate their wallet.

### Step 2: Mint Test Tokens

- Players start by minting 10,000 test tokens using the issue transition.

- These tokens are used to buy buildings and participate in the game.

# Buying Buildings
### Step 3: Purchase a Building

- Players use the monopoly_buy transition to buy a building for 5,000 tokens.

- Each building increases the player's chances of earning rewards when rolling the dice.

- The price of buildings increases by 500 tokens for each subsequent purchase.

# Rolling the Dice
### Step 4: Pay Rent (Roll Dice)

- Players use the monopoly_rent transition to simulate rolling the dice.

- A random number is generated using the ChaCha random mechanism.

- If the player wins, they earn 150 tokens per building they own.

- If they lose, they lose 150 tokens per building.

# Stake-to-Earn Bonus:

- Players who stake at least 5,000,000 [5 aleo] tokens minimum in the Betastaking. [Visit Website](https://testnet.betastaking.com/) contract earn an additional 100 tokens per roll, regardless of the outcome.

# Competing Against Opponents
### Step 5: Request a Game

- Players can challenge another player using the play_request transition.

- A unique game ID is generated using the hash of both players' addresses.

### Step 6: Accept the Game

- The opponent accepts the game using the accept_request transition.

- Both players set a goal (e.g., 400 tokens above their current balance).

### Step 7: Check the Result

- After playing, players use the check_request transition to determine the winner.

- The first player to reach their goal wins 1,000 tokens.

# Minting NFTs
### Step 8: Mint an NFT

- Players who accumulate at least 12,000 tokens can mint an NFT using the mint_nft transition.

- The NFT represents ownership of a specific country in the game.

- NFTs can be used to play mini-games in the future.

# Selling Buildings
### Step 9: Sell a Building

- Players can sell their buildings back to the admin using the monopoly_sale transition.

- The admin pays the player the building price minus a 1,000 token fee.

# Admin Functions

- This is useful for rewarding players or distributing tokens for special events.

# HOW CAN ALEO MONOPOLY ENHANCE PRIVACY USING ALEO 
### Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
**What It Does:**

- Aleo uses zkSNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) to enable private transactions and computations.

- Players can prove they have met certain conditions (e.g., owning enough tokens to mint an NFT) without revealing their actual token balance or other sensitive data.

**How It Enhances Privacy:**

- Players can mint NFTs, roll dice, and compete in games without exposing their wallet balances or transaction history.

- For example, when a player mints an NFT, they prove they have 12,000 tokens without revealing their exact balance.

### Private State Transitions
**What It Does:**

- Aleo allows state transitions (e.g., updating player balances, minting NFTs) to be executed privately.

- The game uses private records to store player data, such as token balances and building ownership.

**How It Enhances Privacy:**

- Player balances and ownership records are stored in encrypted form on the blockchain.

- Only the player (or authorized parties) can decrypt and access their data.

### Encrypted Transactions
**What It Does:**

- All transactions (e.g., buying buildings, paying rent, sending tokens) are encrypted using Aleo's privacy features.

- The details of the transaction (e.g., sender, receiver, amount) are hidden from public view.

**How It Enhances Privacy:**

- Players can buy buildings, pay rent, and send tokens without revealing their wallet addresses or transaction amounts.

- For example, when a player buys a building, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain, but the details are encrypted.

### Private Gameplay
**What It Does:**
